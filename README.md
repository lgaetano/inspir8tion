## Inspir8tion
Once upon a time, there existed an Ada Developers Academy office with an inspiration board...It was a delightful corkboard, where people could anonymously post short messages of encouragement to each other. It was filled with the kindest words and the nerdiest programming jokes.

We've created a digital inspiration board, called "Inspir8tion" to recreate this shared sense of community. 

When a user visits our site, they will be able to add a card with an inspirational message to an existing board, or even create an entirely new board. 

When a user selects a board, they can see all the cards associated with that board. Users can even "+1" the cards that they like!
